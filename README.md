# Development-Of-Antivirus-To-Detect-And-Protect-From-Virus-Using-Python -- refer review-doc

1. ABSTRACT:
People use computers for all kinds of activities: online gaming, shopping, entertainment, emails, social media, study, research, etc. At the same time, the risk of infection by malicious programs in these computers is also on the rise. The main issue here is that the general users usually don't understand what a virus is and how easily computers can get infected. Although these days, there are many vendors that produce antivirus software with different features to prevent or remove these viruses, general users end up not understanding the concept of the features provided in these programs. Additionally, there is no tool to advise users about what the features mean and help them select the right software for personal or business needs. The purpose of this project is to create an antivirus system with various tasks and features that would provide better information to the users on how to tackle these situations in the current digitally enhanced world. A virus program would also be built in order to showcase all the important aspects of the antivirus program.

2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Scope:
In the world of computers and the internet, it is important to verify what you do unless you want to get infected with a malicious piece of code that may hinder performance or just turn your computer or device into a spying system. To understand more let us get formal definitions for viruses and their nemeses’ anti-viruses. A virus is a malicious code that is loaded onto your device with the intent to cause damage and steal information. Computer viruses replicate themselves and occupy all the available memory and result in system damage. Some viruses can replicate and pass on their copies across various networks and bypass security systems as well. To protect your computer or network– an antivirus program is needed.
A generic antivirus software scans identify and remove viruses, computer worms, Trojans, etc. Most antivirus programs are capable of an auto-update feature to stay up-to-date with new virus definitions that are released into the world. They offer on-demand and on-access scanning options and choice varies from user to user. Here we aim at simulating a virus attack, its prevention, and its cure. Some goals that we intend to carry out are as follows:
● To understand intrusion detection systems and their functioning.
● To build a virus that replicates itself in all the .py files present in the same directory.
● To build a system to scan for the presence of a virus in any file using various methods.
● To build an antivirus program that can be used to stop the intrusion caused by the replicating
virus.
